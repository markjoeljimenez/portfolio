shortDescription: >-
  Near the end of my intership, I was brought on to the website redesign project
  for torontopearson.com.  Identical to the work I was doing on Suncor, I was
  also tasked to develop the prototype with HTML (Handlebars), SCSS, and
  TypeScript.


  I also started learning React and Redux to help display Pearsonâ€™s large
  amounts of flight data.


  I was also able to work more with a CMS called Sitecore which involves
  knowledge of the MVC architecture and C#.
