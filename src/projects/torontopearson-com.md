  shortDescription: >-
    Near the end of my intership, I was brought on to the website redesign
    project for torontopearson.com. Identical to the work I was doing on Suncor,
    I was also tasked to develop the prototype with HTML (Handlebars), SCSS, and
    TypeScript.




    I also started learning React and Redux to help display Pearsonâ€™s large
    amounts of flight data.




    I was also able to work more with a CMS called Sitecore which involves
    knowledge of the MVC architecture and C#.
