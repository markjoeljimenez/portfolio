Near the end of my intership, I was brought on to the website redesign project for torontopearson.com. Identical to the work I was doing on Suncor, I was also tasked to develop the prototype with HTML (Handlebars), SCSS, and TypeScript. I also started learning React and Redux to help display Pearsonâ€™s large amounts of flight data. I was also able to work more with a CMS called Sitecore which involves knowledge of the MVC architecture and C#.
