shortDescription: >-
  This was my first project as an intern at Habanero Consulting Group.  I was
  tasked to develop the prototype of the website using technologies such as HTML
  (Handlebars), SCSS, and TypeScript. I was also able to experiment with
  Node.js, Webpack, and Gulp to set up a boilerplate.
