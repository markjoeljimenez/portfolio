			<h1>Hello!</h1>
			<p>
				<br/>
				<br/>My name is Mark Jimenez. I am a recent graduate from George Brown College and majored in Electro-Mechanical Engineering. Although my studies involved hardware, my passion lies within -code-. Since then, I have been elevating this passion of mine onto a more professional level by self-teaching and getting involved in the web development community.
				<br/>
				<br/>As a result of months and months of learning, I have recently obtained a Junior Front-End Developer internship at Habanero Consulting Group. On the side, I am working free-lance where I have worked with 2 clients in the past year.
				<br/>
				<br/>I love to invent, innovate, and expand on new ideas using what I've learned in college and what I'm currently learning throughout my career as a Web Developer.
