After learning about the knapsack problem and it's solutions, I instantly knew that this could be applied to optimizing my NBA drafts in DraftKings.

Some main features that I want to include:

* Adhere to [DK NBA drafting rules](https://www.draftkings.com/help/rules/nba)
* Using stats provided by DK to optimize line up:
  * **FPPG** (fantasy points per game)
  * **OPRK** (offensive/defensive rating vs opposing team)
* Put emphasis/select higher player salaries on certain positions

And for some future features:

* Live game stats (provided by Google?)
* Able to customize line-up dynamically (drag and drop?)
* NBA advanced stats when viewing a player
