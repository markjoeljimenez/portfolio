Yeah, we didn't so well... but hey, at least we didn't end up last! Here are the results:

Taking a look at how the website did, it correctly chose the original 7 players. But since we had to adhere to the rules, we had to manually draft a few players and as you can see, they were terrible.

This minimum number 8 players rule is definitely going to be a big problem but I am determined to get this right!
